# QuickLink

It is a super simple URL shortner that does only one thing. 
It is idiot proof and super intuitive to use. 
More features will be added later, with very careful considerations. 

# Preview

I am yet to figure out some ways to host it for free. You can aslways clone it
and try to run it. But for now here is the video.
